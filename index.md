## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="{{ page.profile_picture }}">
Hi! I am a first year PhD Student in Mathematics at the University of Bonn, working on _O(n)_-models together with Margherita Disertori.

## Research Interest

My background is in functional analysis and PDEs, and in my PhD work I am looking at applications in statistical physics. In particular, I study the _O(n)_ models on rectangular lattices in _d &ge; 3_ dimensions, where a phase transition is known to occur for continuous spin systems. My aim is to improve understanding of said transitions, and develop novel tools to study them. Moreover, I am interested in the mathematics of machine learning from a variational point of view, which I focused on during my masters.
