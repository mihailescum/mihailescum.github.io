## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="{{ page.profile_picture | relative_url }}">
I am a first year PhD Student in Mathematics at the University of Bonn, working on <span class="math">O(n)-</span>models together with Prof. Margherita Disertori.

## Research Interest

My background is in functional analysis and PDEs, and in my PhD work I am looking at applications in statistical physics. In particular, I study the <span class="math">O(n)-</span>models on rectangular lattices in <span class="math">d &ge; 3</span> dimensions, where a phase transition is known to occur for continuous spin systems. My aim is to improve understanding of said transitions, and develop novel tools to study them. Moreover, I am interested in the mathematics of machine learning from a variational point of view, which I focused on during my masters.
